<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Laura Salazar I am a mother of two amazing sons Alejandro and Sebastian.  They are my world. We 
  Live in a small town in San Jose Costa Rica.  Costa Rica is a very small country in the middle of Central 
  America.  This place is absolutely magical and I hope you get to visit it someday.</p>
  

<p>We have a very lazy dog named Winston that really that really has no idea how good a life he leads.  We come from 
  very large and loving family.  Alejandro is currently at the university and Sebastian is in Hight School and they 
both excel in sports and academics which is is mind blowing since I have never been good at either one.</p>

<p>If you are ever in the area.. let us know we would love to know more about your travels and how you got here.</p>
